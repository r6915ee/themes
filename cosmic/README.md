importing themes is under Desktop > Appearance. On the right are two buttons

## Themes

### Warm Contract

Designed for warm backgrounds, in the sense that their most dominant colors
are warm, such as the color orange. "Contract" refers to the fact that some
words in the English language, specifically the United States variation,
possess a pronunciation that depicts the letter C as if it were closer to
the letter S; this goes with the fact that the main colors of this theme
are orange and dark blue, since they contrast well.

This theme is a **dark theme**.

Located under [`warm-contract.ron`](./warm-contract.ron).

### Zen Fields

Designed for backgrounds that prioritize RGB scheming; for example, the left
side's dominant color is red, the middle is green, and the right is blue. This
is primarily an aesthetic theme.

Located under [`zen-fields.ron`](./zen-fields.ron).
